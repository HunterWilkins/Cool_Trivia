# TriviaGame
While this game isn't exactly what was required by explicitly the recommended homework or the challenging homework, it has aspects of both.

It introduces each question (and its choices) one at a time, then waits until you click an answer, tells you whether or not you got it
right (via an alert), and moves on to the next question. After you've gone through all (both) of the questions, the game over screen
pops up and tells you your score.

Currently, there are only two questions, but the code I have could allow for multiple questions. Unfortunately, I only *very* recently
encountered the "aha!" moment when it came to my specific problems regarding the syntax of the requirements. So, I decided to stick with two questions to aid in testing and keep it simple, but functional.

My goal here was mostly to prove the effectiveness of the timer. Running through the program, I'm pretty sure I've ironed out all the bugs.
